            <h4>Standard Pricing:</h4>
            <p>
              Diptimate Consultants Private Limited has a standard pricing policy wherein no additional service fee is requested under any circumstance. However, the standard pricing policy is not applicable for an increase in the total fee paid by the client to Diptimate Consultants Private Limited due to increase in government fee or fee incurred by the client for completion of legal documentation or re-filing of forms with the government due to rejection or resubmission. Diptimate Consultants Private Limited is not responsible or liable for any other cost incurred by the client related to the completion of the service.
            </p>
            <h4>Factors Outside our Control:</h4>
            <p>
              We cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of Diptimate Consultants Private Limited service. In some cases, a government backlog or problems with the government platforms (e.g. MCA website, Income Tax website, FSSAI website) can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, Diptimate Consultants Private Limited does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our Associates on Nearest. Expert platform, who are not employed by Diptimate Consultants Private Limited. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee or eligible for refund. Hence, delay in processing of your file by the Government cannot be a reason for refund.

            <h4>Force Majeure:</h4>
            <p>
              Diptimate Consultants Private Limited shall not be considered in breach of its Satisfaction Guarantee policy or default under any terms of service, and shall not be liable to the Client for any cessation, interruption, or delay in the performance of its obligations by reason of earthquake, flood, fire, storm, lightning, drought, landslide, hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, tornado, natural disaster, act of God or the public enemy, epidemic, famine or plague, action of a court or public authority, change in law, explosion, war, terrorism, armed conflict, labor strike, lockout, boycott or similar event beyond our reasonable control, whether foreseen or unforeseen (each a "Force Majeure Event").
            </p>

            <h3>Cancellation Fee:</h3>
            <p>
              Since we're incurring costs and dedicating time, manpower, technology resources and effort to your service or document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by Diptimate Consultants Private Limited - not changes to your situation or your state of mind. In case you require us to hold the processing of a service, we will hold the fee paid on your account until you are ready to commence the service.
