                        <h2> About <span>Nidhi Company</span></h2>
                        <p>
                          The word ‘Nidhi’ within the Hindu religion denotes
                          treasure. Nidhi Companies are recognized under
                          Section 406 of Companies Act, 2013. A Nidhi
                          Company in India belongs to the non-banking
                          financial sector (NBFC) and is incorporated
                          primarily with the target of encouraging the habit
                          of saving and creating reserve funds amongst its
                          members whereby the corporate receives deposits
                          from its members and may lend money only to its
                          members for mutual benefit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For Nidhi company doesn't require RBI Approval
                          (RBI Circular DNBS.PD.
                          CC.No.336/03.02.004/2013-14), Nidhi company
                          registration is straightforward and no got to
                          visit a office .
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Enter slice may be leader in Nidhi company
                          registration, providing services for RD, FD &
                          Nidhi company Business plan etc. the rationale
                          behind choosing Nidhi Company needs minimum 7
                          members with 5 lakhs capital for incorporation
                          that is very low compared to start out of the
                          other sort of NBFC of Banks and limitations of
                          Nidhi Company is it can borrow and lend money only
                          between its members. It inculcates the habit of
                          saving among its members and works on the
                          principle of mutual benefit. Nidhi Company is one
                          among the classifications of Non-Banking Financial
                          Company (NBFC) which doesn't require any Federal
                          Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permit. Nidhi Company
                          works though its individuals.

                            of those 7 members, 3 will be director and shareholder; remaining 4 will be only
                            shareholders. It is to be noted that the term “Shareholder” &amp; “Member” both are same.
